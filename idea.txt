The idea of this projext is to check a bunch of websites to see if any
particular username is taken. You would choose a username and the program
would go through all different websites showing whether or not the username
is taken.



Further ideas:
-Automatically make accounts for websites that don't have the username taken.

-Have a secondary username to make with if it is taken. 

-Check like domain names, email names, anything else too.

-Some webistes will have different rules about what a username can be, i.e
no special characters, no swear words..
